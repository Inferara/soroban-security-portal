# Wasmi module works with no crashes

In our fuzz test, we are using wasm-smith module which generates random Web Assembly modules and we run the functions generated by wasm-smith with random inputs over wasmi and check if the interpreter crashes at any step of the run.

## **Scope**

We are testing the wasmi module which is used by soroban-env-rs repository. wasmi module provides an interpreter to run Web Assembly (WASM) code and as Soroban depends on wasmi as an interpreter, we test it with random Web Assembly code.

## **Specification**

In our fuzz test, we are using wasm-smith module which generates random Web Assembly modules based on some parameters (number of imports, whether to use reference types, number of instructions, etc.) and we run the functions generated by wasm-smith with random inputs (either primitive values or random function references) over wasmi and check if the interpreter crashes at any step of the run.
